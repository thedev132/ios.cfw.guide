This usually means that you can only update to the most recent firmware versions. This is bad for jailbreaking, as most jailbreaks rely on exploits that have been patched in newer versions.</p><p>Fortunately, we can use different &quot;profiles&quot; to delay a firmware update. This is intended for organisations which require additional time to update their devices, however we can also use these to update to unsigned firmware versions.</p><p>This has a time limit, however. You will only be able to update to the following firmware versions before their respective expiration dates:</p><ul><li><strong>16.0.2</strong> - January 8th, 2023</li><li><strong>15.7</strong> (<em>iPads which got 16.x on 14.4.2 or older only</em>) -
